## Versioning

For transparency and insight into my release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Sharon Chin Theme - as all my WordPress APIs - will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
