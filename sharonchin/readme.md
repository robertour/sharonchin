A WordPress Theme based on Bootstrap, from Twitter

## Description

The Theme is 100% responsive - you do not need a seperate mobile-Theme with this layout.
It has a seperate Sidebar just for image pages, to make it a special place to show your pictures!
Sharon Chin is fully compatible with WordPress SEO by Yoast! 

Please note:

Due to design restrictions in Bootstrap, the navigation menu can "only" be three levels deep, while parent menu items only serves as a headline for the child menu items and can not be accessed over the navigation menu.
The Footer Menu is best suitable for short menues with just a few links. It replaces the credits section, once a menu has been assigned to the location.
To take advantage of all the possibilites Bootstrap has to offer, Bootstrap requires jQuery 1.7, which does not come with WordPress versions prior to 3.3.0. Consider adding a plugin that provides the lates version of jQuery, if you want to use this Theme with WordPress 3.2.1 or lower.
